This repository contains my some project I have been working on during my free time.
Each folder contains a specific project I've worked on. I tried to make the directory's name self-explanatory of its content.

## [African Crisis Prediction](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/African%20Crisis%20Prediction)
This is a Master's project where I heiped my supervisor with his students. The aim is to be able to prediction a bank crisis given the systemic crise, the exchange rate again the USD, inflation crise, and so on. We test a set of shallow machine learning algorithms and got some interesting results.
