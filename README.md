# projects
This repository contains some projects I have been working on.
Each folder contains a specific project I've worked on. I tried to make the directory's name self-explanatory of its content.

## [African Crisis Prediction](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/African%20Crisis%20Prediction)
This is a Master's project where I heiped my supervisor with his students. The aim is to be able to prediction a bank crisis given the systemic crise, the exchange rate again the USD, inflation crise, and so on. We test a set of shallow machine learning algorithms and got some interesting results. 

## [Customer segmentation](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/Customer%20segmentation)
This is another Master's project I worked on with my supervisor. Given, an online retail customer's data, we want to segment them into different group: High-value customers, Mid-value customers and Low-value customers. To achieve the results we want, we used the RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) technique. Then, we analysed each group to get more insights of the kind of products they purchased the most.

## [Forecasting: Ivory Cost Population Growth Rate Prediction](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/Forecasting)
In this project I extracted the Ivorian population growth rate from the World Bank Data using their API. Then, I used that data to forecast the growth over ten years with an error margin.

## [Gun Deaths in US 2012-2014](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/Gun%20Deaths%20in%20US%202012-2014)
This is a simple my first analysis I have ever done. Here, I used the following  python packages: csv (to handle csv files), re (for regular expression) and datetime (to manipulate dates).

## [Sales Data Visualization](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/tree/master/Sales%20Data%20Visualization)
In this project, I did some visualization of a geospatial data. We visualized the Payment type on the world map using cartopy.

## [plotly_dash_app.zip](https://github.com/malick-jaures/training_projects/blob/master/plotly_dash_app.zip)
Simple data visualization using Plotly (Python interactive graphing library) and Dash (Python framework for building web applications).
